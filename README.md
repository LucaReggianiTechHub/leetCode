# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions! This repository contains solutions to a variety of problems from LeetCode, implemented in **Python** and **Java**. The problems are categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and topic (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming, etc.), making it easy to navigate and find solutions based on your current skill level and the problem type.

## Folder Structure

Each language folder (Python/Java) contains subfolders categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard). Inside these difficulty-based folders, problems are further organized by topic.
