# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions! This repository contains solutions to a variety of problems from LeetCode, implemented in **Python**. The problems are organized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming, etc.), making it easy to navigate and find solutions based on the problem type. Inside each problem's folder, you'll find the code and a detailed explanation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following structure:

```
leetCode/
├── Python/
│   ├── Arrays/
│   │   ├── ArrayProblem1/
│   │   │   ├── ArrayProblem1.py
│   │   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── ArrayProblem2/
│   │   │   ├── ArrayProblem2.py
│   │   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Strings/
│   │   ├── StringProblem1/
│   │   │   ├── StringProblem1.py
│   │   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── StringProblem2/
│   │   │   ├── StringProblem2.py
│   │   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
```

## Contents

Each problem's folder contains:

- **Code**: The solution implemented in Python.
- **README**: A detailed explanation of the problem, including:
  - Problem Statement
  - Intuition
  - Approach
  - Complexity Analysis
  - Code with comments
  - The **level of difficulty** is indicated in the `README.md`.

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to a Topic**: Choose the topic you're interested in (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming) within the `Python` folder.
2. **Select a Problem**: Inside the topic folder, select a problem by navigating into its dedicated folder.
3. **Review Solution and Explanation**:
   - Open the `.py` file to view the solution code.
   - Open the `README.md` to read the problem statement and the detailed explanation of the solution.

Feel free to **clone** or **fork** the repository to test the solutions on your local machine!

## Future Work

- **Java Solutions Coming Soon**: Plans are underway to include solutions implemented in **Java**. Stay tuned for updates!
